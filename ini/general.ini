    - can be increased with powerups
- size of shot
    - outer ring represents projectile

[powerups]
    - mine
        -> can be deployed in the dark
        -> deployment sound
        -> possibly multiple mines per powerup
    - aura
        -> radius of player's light aura increases
    - size of shot
        -> increases radius of outer ring
    - health
        -> increases radius of inner ring
